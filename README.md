Client-related attributes: age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan

Contact attributes: contact, month, day_of_week, duration

Campaign-related attributes: campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome

Socioeconomic context attributes: emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, nr.employed


The target variable (y) is binary:

no: the client did not subscribe
